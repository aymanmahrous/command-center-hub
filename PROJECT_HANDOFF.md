# Command Center Hub Project Handoff

## Current stage

Final Audit on branch `audit/final-audit` after the protected merges of AI Inbox PR #9, Bookings PR #10, Content Studio PR #11, Media Library PR #12, Analytics PR #13, Integrations PR #14, and System Polish PR #15.

## Implemented

- Real conversation list through the existing `get_staff_inbox` RPC.
- Real message history through `get_staff_conversation_messages`.
- Confirmed, role-gated conversation mode changes through `set_staff_conversation_mode`.
- Complete mode support: `ai_active`, `human_required`, `human_takeover`, and `paused`.
- In-flight locking, safe error states, session-expiry handling, and responsive UI.
- Security-contract coverage for RPC-only writes, RBAC, confirmation, duplicate prevention, and the mode allowlist.
- Bookings operational summary, search, status filters, full existing request context, and safe session-expiry handling.
- Bookings status writes remain exclusively on `update_booking_request_status` with confirmation and a single in-flight lock.
- Real Content Studio records with search, status filtering, editable content fields, and published-content protection.
- Content editing remains exclusively on `update_staff_content_item`; review and schedule transitions remain exclusively on `transition_staff_content_item`.
- Content mutations use server-aligned RBAC, explicit confirmation, a global in-flight lock, safe session-expiry handling, and the RPC-provided Audit Log.
- Real employee-owned media assets are presented through `get_staff_media_assets` with counts, search, type/source filters, content linkage, provider context, prompts, and bounded metadata.
- Media Library remains strictly read-only and does not expose private Storage URLs or any upload, generation, update, or deletion path.
- Real aggregate growth metrics are presented through `get_staff_growth_analytics` with response validation and zero-safe descriptive ratios.
- Analytics keeps the backend `attributionReady` limitation visible and does not claim campaign conversion, causality, or ROI without attribution links.
- Integrations validates and presents the existing operations queue through `get_staff_operations_queue` with status/search filters, overdue detection, bounded errors, and explicit source limitations.
- Integrations remains read-only and does not expose retry, cancel, provider-test, credential, webhook, or direct-table actions.
- System Polish cancels stale reads, aligns CRM session expiry and global write locking, validates local dates safely, and improves keyboard/loading semantics without changing RPC behavior.
- Final Audit adds reproducible dependency locking, moves build tooling out of runtime dependencies, and makes CI use a locked, script-free Node 22 install.
