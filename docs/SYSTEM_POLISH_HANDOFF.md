# System Polish Handoff

## Scope

- Cancels stale dashboard and conversation-message reads when the user changes context or the component unmounts.
- Handles expired sessions consistently in the controlled CRM workflow.
- Validates local follow-up dates before conversion and safely renders invalid server timestamps as empty inputs.
- Applies one global CRM write lock across every lead form while a mutation is in flight.
- Adds a skip link, visible keyboard focus, current-page navigation semantics, loading state semantics, and polite operational notices.
- Updates the document title with the active internal module.

## Security and behavior boundary

- Existing authenticated RPC contracts and RBAC rules are unchanged.
- No mutation, database, migration, RLS/policy, cron, worker, service-role, deployment, public-site, or production configuration change was introduced.
- Aborting stale reads is client-side cleanup only; confirmed writes are never automatically retried or cancelled by this change.

## Verification

- `npm run typecheck`: passed on 2026-07-22.
- `npm test`: passed 26/26 on 2026-07-22.
- `npm run build`: passed on 2026-07-22.
- React review confirmed unconditional hooks, complete abort cleanup, semantic controls, stable list keys, and keyboard focus visibility.
- The complete branch diff contains no direct-table access, secret exposure, or prohibited path.

## Rollback

Revert the System Polish merge commit or restore the previous Command Center deployment. No database or public-site rollback is required.
