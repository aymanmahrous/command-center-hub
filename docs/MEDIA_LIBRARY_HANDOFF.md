# Media Library Operations Handoff

## Scope

- Reads the current employee's real media assets through the existing `get_staff_media_assets` RPC.
- Provides asset-type counts, search, source/type filters, content linkage, provider context, prompts, and bounded metadata summaries.
- Treats every storage-backed asset as private and does not construct or expose a storage URL.

## Safety boundary

- The module is strictly read-only.
- No Storage upload, signed-URL generation, provider generation, job update, record creation, deletion, or direct table call is present.
- No mutation RPC is called because this standalone frontend has no complete RPC-only upload or private-preview contract.
- Invalid response shapes fail closed and render no asset records.
- Authentication and employee authorization remain enforced by the shared session and the existing RPC.

## Verification

- `npm run typecheck`: passed on 2026-07-22.
- `npm test`: passed 20/20 on 2026-07-22.
- `npm run build`: passed on 2026-07-22.
- No real file, provider job, Storage object, or Production record was accessed or changed during verification.

## Explicit exclusions

- No migration, RLS/policy, cron, worker, service-role credential, direct table write, Storage write, secret, public-site change, or Production deployment is included.
- Private previews require a future existing approved RPC or same-origin server contract; this stage does not weaken privacy to provide them.
